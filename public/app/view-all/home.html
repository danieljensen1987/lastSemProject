<p style="margin-top: 10px;color:#105cb6;font-weight: bold">This seed shows a "typical" layout for an application that requires authentication and use
  roles to distinguish
  between what logged on users can do.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b style="display: inline-block;width:7em;" >View1</b> Can be seen by all</li>
  <li><b style="display: inline-block;width:7em;">Users Only</b> Access to data (REST) requires user to be logged on as a <em>user</em></li>
  <li><b style="display: inline-block;width:7em;">Admins only</b> Access to data (REST) requires user to be logged on as <em>admin</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Test Users: (logon with these credentials to test)</h2>
<ul style="font-size: large">
  <li><b style="display: inline-block;width:5em;">Admin:</b>username = teacher, password = test</li>
  <li><b style="display: inline-block;width:5em;">User:</b>username = student, password = test</li>
</ul>
<h2>Using the Security Features in this seed - <em>Server:</em></h2>
<P>All REST services placed in the file REST_Admin_API.js requires admin rights</P>
<p>All REST services placed in the file REST_User_API.js requires user rights</p>
<p>Username, password, and roles are hardcoded in index.js (your task is to place this info "somewhere")</p>
<h2>Using the Security Features in this seed - <em>Client</em>:</h2>
<p>Logon/logof is ready to use.</p>
<p>A token with credentials is automatically is attached to all outgoing AJAX requests (when you are logged on) </p>
<p>In this version users can see all menu items (even if they do not have the necessary rights). This is for you to

  observe when and where security takes place (bring up F12 in chrome and monitor the network traffic)<p>
<p>You can hide elements so they are only visible with the required security role. Add <code>ng-show="isUser"</code> to
  the "Users
  Only" anchor tag in index.html and <code>ng-show="isAdmin"</code> on the "Admins Only" tag. To see this in action.</p>
<p>Everything you do, that relates to security on the client, can be tampered with, so the trick above should be seen as
  something to make the system more user friendly. <span style="text-decoration: underline">The real security is how REST (our data) is protected on the server. </span>
  </p>
        <p>Security in this seed was inspired by this article <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/2014/01/07/angularjs-authentication-with-cookies-vs-token/">Cookies vs Tokens. Getting auth right with Angular.JS</a></p>

<h3 style="color: darkred;"><em>Note: This seed is not meant for production. The most obvious flaw is that username and
  password are sent unencrypted</em></h3>
