<p style="margin-top: 10px;color:#105cb6;font-weight: bold">This application shows our idea of how to create a study points system for teachers and students.
  <br/>
  The original seed has been severely modified and can now handle "real" authentication <br/>
  and use roles to distinguish between what logged on users can do.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b style="display: inline-block;width:13em;" >Home</b> Can be seen by all</li>
  <li><b style="display: inline-block;width:13em;">My Profile</b> Access to data (REST) requires user to be logged on as a <em>Student</em></li>
  <li><b style="display: inline-block;width:13em;">MyClasses, add and Edit </b> Access to data (REST) requires user to be logged on as <em>Teacher or Admin</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Test Users: (logon with these credentials to test)</h2>
<ul style="font-size: large">
  <li><b style="display: inline-block;width:5em;">Teacher:</b>username = sybilmcguire@maroptic.com, password = test</li>
  <li><b style="display: inline-block;width:5em;">Student:</b>username = vincentpena@maroptic.com, password = test</li>
</ul>
<h2>Using the Security Features in this seed - <em>Server:</em></h2>
<P>All REST services placed in the file REST_Admin_API.js requires admin rights</P>
<p>All REST services placed in the file REST_User_API.js requires user rights</p>

<h2>Using the Security Features in this seed - <em>Client</em>:</h2>
<p>A token with credentials is automatically attached to all outgoing AJAX requests (when you are logged on) </p>
<p>Security in this seed was inspired by these article:</p>

<h3 style="color: darkred;"><em>Note: This seed is not meant for production. The most obvious flaw is that username and
  password are sent unencrypted</em></h3>
